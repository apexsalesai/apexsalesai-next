Based on your Neon screenshot, use these EXACT connection strings:

FOR POOLED CONNECTION (DATABASE_URL):
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://neondb_owner:ApexMax42XyZ@ep-misty-surf-adv6olws-pooler.c-2.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require"

FOR DIRECT CONNECTION (DIRECT_URL):
DIRECT_URL="postgresql://neondb_owner:ApexMax42XyZ@ep-misty-surf-adv6olws.c-2.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require"

NOTE: I removed &channel_binding=require because Prisma doesn't support it.
NOTE: I removed &pgbouncer=true because Neon's pooler already handles that.

Replace lines 4-5 in your .env file with these two lines.
