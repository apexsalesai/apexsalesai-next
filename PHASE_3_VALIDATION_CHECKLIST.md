- [ ] Service principal has least-privilege access

### Dataverse Configuration
- [ ] Table created: `Apex Campaign Metrics` (`apex_campaignmetrics`)
- [ ] All 13 columns added with correct types
- [ ] Change tracking enabled
- [ ] Security roles configured (read/write access)
- [ ] Test record manually created and verified

### Power Automate Flow
- [ ] Flow created: "Apex Campaign Metrics Sync"

- [ ] PostgreSQL connection configured (Neon)
- [ ] Dataverse connection configured
- [ ] Flow tested with sample data
- [ ] Error handling configured (retry policy)
- [ ] Run history shows successful executions

### Application Code
- [ ] `lib/dataverse/token.ts` - OAuth2 token client with caching
- [ ] `lib/dataverse/getMetrics.ts` - Dataverse API reader
- [ ] `lib/metrics/writeCampaignMetrics.ts` - Metrics writer function
- [ ] `app/api/metrics/recent/route.ts` - API endpoint
- [ ] `app/studio/components/MetricsPanel.tsx` - UI component
- [ ] All imports resolve correctly
- [ ] No circular dependencies

### Environment Variables
- [ ] `AZURE_TENANT_ID` set in `.env.local`
- [ ] `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` set in `.env.local`
- [ ] `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` set in `.env.local`
- [ ] `DATAVERSE_RESOURCE` set in `.env.local`
- [ ] All 4 variables added to Vercel Environment Variables
- [ ] Secrets masked in Vercel dashboard
- [ ] Variables documented in `PHASE_3_DATAVERSE_SETUP.md`

## üß™ Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- [ ] `writeCampaignMetrics()` writes to database correctly
- [ ] `getDataverseToken()` returns valid access token
- [ ] `getRecentMetrics()` fetches data from Dataverse
- [ ] Token caching works (no redundant auth requests)
- [ ] Error handling graceful (missing credentials, network failures)

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Write test metric to `campaign_metrics` table
- [ ] Power Automate flow picks up pending metrics
- [ ] Dataverse record created successfully
- [ ] `exported_at` timestamp updated in Neon
- [ ] Studio API `/api/metrics/recent` returns data
- [ ] MetricsPanel component displays live KPIs

### End-to-End Validation
- [ ] Run full campaign in Studio
- [ ] Metrics written to Neon automatically
- [ ] Flow syncs to Dataverse within 5 minutes
- [ ] Metrics Panel shows updated data
- [ ] All 5 KPI tiles display correct values
- [ ] Refresh works (10s polling interval)

### Performance Benchmarks
- [ ] API response time < 2.5s (P95)
- [ ] Token acquisition < 1s
- [ ] Dataverse query < 2s
- [ ] MetricsPanel load time < 1.8s (LCP)
- [ ] No memory leaks in token caching
- [ ] Database queries use indexes efficiently
