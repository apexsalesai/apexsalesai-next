# üö® EMERGENCY FIX - SERVER WON'T START

## üî¥ **THE PROBLEM**

The `.next/trace` file is locked by a Node.js process that won't die. This prevents the dev server from starting.

**Error:**
```
Error: EPERMS: operation not permitted, open 'C:\users\apexs\apexsalesai-next\.next\trace'
```

---

## ‚úÖ **SOLUTION 1: RESTART COMPUTER (FASTEST)**

1. **Save all your work**
2. **Restart Windows**
3. After restart, run:
   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\apexs\apexsalesai-next
   npm run dev
   ```

**This will work 100%** - it kills all locked processes.

---

## ‚úÖ **SOLUTION 2: MANUAL CLEANUP (IF YOU CAN'T RESTART)**

### **Step 1: Close Everything**
1. Close VS Code completely
2. Close all terminals
3. Close all browsers

### **Step 2: Kill Node Processes**
Open PowerShell as **Administrator** and run:
```powershell
Get-Process node -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Stop-Process -Force
```

### **Step 3: Delete .next Folder**
Still in PowerShell as Admin:
```powershell
cd C:\Users\apexs\apexsalesai-next
Remove-Item .next -Recurse -Force
```

### **Step 4: Restart Dev Server**
```bash
npm run dev
```

---

## ‚úÖ **SOLUTION 3: USE DIFFERENT PORT (WORKAROUND)**

If .next is locked, try running on a different port:

```bash
PORT=3004 npm run dev
```

Then access: `http://localhost:3004`

---

## ‚úÖ **SOLUTION 4: NUCLEAR OPTION**

If nothing else works:

1. **Close VS Code**
2. **Open Task Manager** (Ctrl+Shift+Esc)
3. **Go to Details tab**
4. **Find all `node.exe` processes**
5. **Right-click each ‚Üí End Task**
6. **Open File Explorer**
7. **Navigate to:** `C:\Users\apexs\apexsalesai-next`
8. **Delete `.next` folder** (if it still won't delete, restart computer)
9. **Reopen VS Code**
10. **Run:** `npm run dev`

---

## üéØ **RECOMMENDED: SOLUTION 1 (RESTART)**

**Just restart your computer.** It's the fastest and most reliable fix.

After restart:
```bash
cd C:\Users\apexs\apexsalesai-next
npm run dev
```

**Then test:** `http://localhost:3000`

---

## üîç **WHY THIS HAPPENED**

- Node.js process didn't shut down cleanly
- `.next/trace` file got locked
- Windows file locking prevents deletion
- Only way to unlock: kill process or restart

---

## üìã **AFTER IT'S WORKING**

Once the server starts successfully:

1. Test content generation at `/studio/create`
2. Test resume upload at `/career`
3. Run through the test checklist in `MVP_TEST_CHECKLIST.md`

---

## üöÄ **PREVENTION**

To avoid this in the future:

1. Always stop the dev server with **Ctrl+C** (not closing terminal)
2. Wait for "Gracefully shutting down" message
3. If server hangs, use: `npm run clean-dev`

---

**TL;DR: Restart your computer, then run `npm run dev`** üîÑ
