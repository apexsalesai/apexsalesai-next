- ‚úÖ 2025-10-12: Merge pull request #1 from apexsalesai/apexsalesai-admin-patch-1

Delete pages/api/kpis.ts
- ‚úÖ 2025-10-12: chore: trigger redeploy after removing pages/api/kpis.ts
- ‚úÖ 2025-10-13: chore: trigger deploy
- ‚úÖ 2025-10-13: chore: trigger Vercel build
- ‚úÖ 2025-10-13: Merge pull request #3 from apexsalesai/fix-build-datefns

Fix build datefns
- ‚úÖ 2025-10-13: chore: trigger prod deploy
- ‚úÖ 2025-10-13: chore: trigger prod deploy
- ‚úÖ 2025-10-13: build: ignore Node-only modules in client bundle
- ‚úÖ 2025-10-14: build: ignore Node-only modules in client bundle
- ‚úÖ 2025-10-14: fix(build): add webpack path aliases for Vercel deployment

- Configure webpack resolve.alias in next.config.js
- Map @, @components, @lib to correct directories
- Resolves module not found errors in Vercel build
- Ensures path aliases work in both dev and production
- ‚úÖ 2025-10-14: merge: resolve conflict in dataverseApi.ts
- ‚úÖ 2025-10-14: fix(dataverse): refactor to static methods and fix import paths

BREAKING CHANGES:
- DataverseApiService now uses static methods instead of instance methods
- All KPI services updated to use static DataverseApiService.query()

FIXES:
- Fix @/lib path alias to @lib for correct webpack resolution
- Remove NextAuth dependencies (app uses Auth0)
- Fix app/api/loads/route.ts to use correct imports
- Update all KPI services to use static methods
- Add type annotations for implicit any errors
- Remove orderBy from query options (not supported)

RESULT: Build compiles successfully, zero type errors
- ‚úÖ 2025-10-14: fix(prisma): add postinstall script for Vercel deployment

- Add 'prisma generate' to postinstall script
- Update build script to run prisma generate before next build
- Resolves Prisma Client outdated cache issue on Vercel

This ensures Prisma Client is regenerated after npm install on Vercel
- ‚úÖ 2025-10-14: fix(auth): prevent Auth0 initialization errors during build

- Wrap handleAuth() in runtime check for environment variables
- Return 501 error if Auth0 not configured instead of crashing build
- Prevents 'invalid_client_credential' error during Vercel build

This allows the build to complete even if Auth0 env vars aren't set,
while still providing clear error messages at runtime.
- ‚úÖ 2025-10-14: fix(auth): lazy initialize MSAL client to prevent build errors

CRITICAL FIX:
- MSAL ConfidentialClientApplication was initializing at module load time
- This caused 'invalid_client_credential' errors during Vercel build
- Changed to lazy initialization using getter pattern

CHANGES:
- Convert msalClient from static property to lazy-loaded getter
- Only initializes when actually accessed (runtime, not build time)
- Prevents build failures when DATAVERSE env vars not set

This is the root cause of the deployment failures.
