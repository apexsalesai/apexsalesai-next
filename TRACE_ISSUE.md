## 🎯 Most Likely Issue

**The OpenAI API key doesn't have access to the `gpt-4o` model.**

This would cause a 404 error from OpenAI, which would appear as a 500 error in the frontend.

## 🚀 Immediate Action Plan

1. **Check Vercel Runtime Logs** (get exact error)
2. **If 404 error:** Change model to `gpt-4-turbo`
3. **If 401 error:** Regenerate API key
4. **If 429 error:** Add credits or wait
