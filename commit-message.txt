chore(auth): fully remove NextAuth in favor of Microsoft Entra ID

ARCHITECTURAL DECISION:
- Echo Breaker now uses Microsoft Entra ID exclusively
- Aligns with enterprise Microsoft stack (Azure OpenAI, Key Vault, etc.)
- Zero additional cost vs Auth0 (saves $240-1400/month)
- Better enterprise customer alignment (existing M365 accounts)
- Unified identity across ApexSalesAI product suite

CHANGES:
- Removed NextAuth directories and config files
- Uninstalled next-auth package and dependencies
- Cleaned NEXTAUTH_* environment variables
- Implemented Entra ID routes at /api/entra/*
- Auth0 reserved at /api/auth/[...auth0] for future use

FINAL ARCHITECTURE:
- Auth0: /api/auth/[...auth0] (reserved)
- Entra ID: /api/entra/* (active - Echo Breaker)
- Zero NextAuth references in codebase

This is a foundational architectural decision for enterprise readiness.
