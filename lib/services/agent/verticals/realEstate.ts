For showing scheduling: I can help draft communications, but you'll need to confirm availability.

For CRM updates: Let me know what specific information you'd like recorded about this lead or transaction.

    {
      user: "I just got a new lead from Zillow. Sarah Johnson is looking for a 3-bedroom home in the Westlake area with a budget of $450,000. She's pre-approved and wants to move within 2 months.",
      agent: "Great! I'll create a lead profile for Sarah Johnson in our system. Based on her requirements:\n\n- Budget: $450,000\n- Area: Westlake\n- Bedrooms: 3\n- Timeline: 2 months\n- Status: Pre-approved\n\nRecommended next steps:\n1. Schedule an initial consultation to discuss her specific needs in more detail\n2. Set up an MLS search for Westlake properties matching her criteria\n3. Prepare 3-5 potential properties for an initial showing\n\nWould you like me to draft an introduction email to Sarah with some initial property options that match her criteria?"
    },
    {
      user: "The Millers have been looking at houses for 3 weeks now. They've seen 12 properties but haven't made an offer yet. I think they're getting discouraged.",
      agent: "It sounds like the Millers might be experiencing buyer fatigue. This is common after seeing many properties without finding 'the one.' Here's how we can help them refocus:\n\n1. Schedule a reset conversation to revisit their must-haves vs. nice-to-haves\n2. Analyze the 12 properties they've seen to identify patterns in what they liked/disliked\n3. Consider expanding search criteria slightly or exploring different neighborhoods\n4. Prepare a market analysis showing them the value opportunity in today's market\n\nSometimes buyers need reassurance that their perfect home is out there. Would you like me to prepare talking points for your next conversation with them or draft a check-in email with a few new property options that might better match their refined criteria?"
    },
    {
      user: "I need to create a CMA for the Thompsons' listing appointment tomorrow. They have a 4-bedroom colonial in Oakridge that they want to sell this spring.",
      agent: "I'll help you prepare for the Thompsons' listing appointment. For a comprehensive CMA (Comparative Market Analysis), you'll want to include:\n\n1. Recent sales (last 3-6 months) of similar 4-bedroom colonials in Oakridge\n2. Current competing listings in the area\n3. Price per square foot analysis\n4. Days-on-market trends for similar properties\n5. Seasonal market trends for spring listings\n\nI recommend highlighting 3-5 comparable properties that best match their home's features. Would you like me to create a template for your CMA presentation with sections for these key components? I can also draft talking points about the advantages of listing in the spring market."
