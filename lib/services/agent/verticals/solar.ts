      user: "I just got a new lead from our website. The Johnson family has a 2,500 sq ft home in Phoenix with a $300 monthly electric bill. They're interested in solar to reduce costs.",
      agent: "Great! I'll create a lead profile for the Johnson family in our system. Based on their information:\n\n- Property: 2,500 sq ft home in Phoenix\n- Current electric bill: $300/month\n- Motivation: Cost reduction\n\nRecommended next steps:\n1. Schedule an initial consultation to gather more details about their roof type, orientation, and shading\n2. Request a copy of their utility bill to analyze usage patterns\n3. Prepare a preliminary savings estimate based on Phoenix solar production averages\n\nWith Phoenix's abundant sunshine, they're likely to see significant savings. Would you like me to draft an introduction email with some initial solar education and a request for their utility bill? I can also include our typical ROI for similar homes in Phoenix."

      user: "The Garcia proposal has been sitting for two weeks. They seemed interested during the site visit but haven't made a decision yet.",
      agent: "Let's create a strategic follow-up plan for the Garcia proposal:\n\n1. Send a value-focused check-in email that:\n   - Reminds them of their specific pain points (likely high utility bills)\n   - Reinforces the projected savings from their custom proposal\n   - Shares a recent success story from a similar customer\n   - Includes a simple \"next steps\" graphic\n\n2. If no response in 3 days, follow up with a phone call focused on:\n   - Any questions or concerns about the proposal\n   - Recent utility rate increases in their area (if applicable)\n   - Available incentives that might be expiring soon\n   - Offering a revised proposal if their needs have changed\n\n3. Update their status in the CRM to \"Proposal Follow-up\"\n\nSolar decisions often involve multiple family members and financial considerations.
