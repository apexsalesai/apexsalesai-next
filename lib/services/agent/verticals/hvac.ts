      user: "I just got a new lead from our website. The Smith family has a 2,200 sq ft home with a 15-year-old AC unit that isn't cooling properly. They're interested in a replacement before summer.",
      agent: "Great! I'll create a lead profile for the Smith family in our system. Based on their information:\n\n- Property: 2,200 sq ft home\n- Current system: 15-year-old AC unit\n- Issue: Not cooling properly\n- Timeline: Before summer\n\nRecommended next steps:\n1. Schedule a home assessment to evaluate their current system and home layout\n2. Prepare information on energy-efficient replacement options (likely 3-4 ton systems)\n3. Check for any available utility rebates for high-efficiency replacements\n\nWith a 15-year-old unit, they're likely to see significant energy savings with a modern system. Would you like me to draft an introduction email highlighting the benefits of replacing their aging system and requesting a convenient time for the home assessment?"

      user: "Westview Apartments signed the contract yesterday for replacing 12 units across their complex. We need to coordinate with their property management team on scheduling.",
      agent: "Congratulations on closing the Westview Apartments deal! Let's get the multi-unit replacement process moving efficiently:\n\n1. Update their status in the CRM to \"Signed - Pre-Installation\"\n2. Create a project folder with the following documents:\n   - Signed contract\n   - Unit specifications\n   - Property layout\n   - Installation schedule template\n\n3. Prepare for the installation:\n   - Order all 12 units and confirm delivery timeline\n   - Create a phased installation plan (typically 2-3 units per day)\n   - Prepare tenant notification templates for property management\n\n4. Schedule a kickoff meeting with their property management team to discuss:\n   - Unit access protocol\n   - Tenant notification process\n   - Installation sequence preferences\n   - Emergency contact information\n\nWould you like me to draft the kickoff meeting invitation to the property management team and prepare a phased installation schedule template to review with them?"

    {
      user: "The Rodriguez family got our proposal for a new heat pump system two weeks ago but haven't made a decision yet. They seemed concerned about the upfront cost.",
      agent: "Let's create a strategic follow-up plan for the Rodriguez family that addresses their cost concerns:\n\n1. Send a value-focused check-in email that:\n   - Acknowledges their concern about upfront costs\n   - Provides more detail on financing options with low monthly payments\n   - Calculates their estimated monthly energy savings\n   - Shows net monthly cost after energy savings\n   - Mentions any available tax credits or utility rebates\n\n2. If no response in 3 days, follow up with a phone call focused on:\n   - Any questions about the financing options\n   - The long-term cost of continuing with their current system\n   - Offering a revised proposal with good-better-best options\n\n3. Update their status in the CRM to \"Proposal Follow-up - Financing Focus\"\n\nHVAC decisions often involve balancing upfront costs with long-term savings. Would you like me to draft the follow-up email with a simple cost comparison table showing monthly financing payment versus projected energy savings? I can also prepare talking points about the reliability issues and increasing repair costs they might face with their current system."
