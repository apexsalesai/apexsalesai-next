      user: "I just got a new lead from Rocket Mortgage. Michael Chen is looking to buy his first home with a budget of $350,000. He has a 720 credit score and can put 10% down.",
      agent: "Great! I'll create a lead profile for Michael Chen in our system. Based on his information:\n\n- Budget: $350,000\n- Credit Score: 720\n- Down Payment: 10% ($35,000)\n- First-time homebuyer: Yes\n\nRecommended next steps:\n1. Schedule an initial consultation to discuss his complete financial picture\n2. Prepare pre-qualification options (conventional with PMI, potentially FHA)\n3. Discuss first-time homebuyer programs he might qualify for\n\nWould you like me to draft an introduction email to Michael with information about the pre-qualification process and a list of documents he'll need to provide?"

      user: "The Jacksons' loan is stuck in underwriting. They've been asked for additional documentation about their self-employment income, and they're getting frustrated.",
      agent: "I understand the Jacksons are feeling frustrated with the additional documentation requests for their self-employment income. This is a common challenge with self-employed borrowers.\n\n1. Let's prepare a clear, itemized list of exactly what underwriting needs\n2. Schedule a quick call to explain why these documents are necessary\n3. Offer to review their documents before submission to ensure they meet requirements\n4. Set expectations about timeline once documents are received\n\nSelf-employment documentation can be complex, but reassuring them that this is normal and you're there to help can ease their frustration. Would you like me to draft a supportive email explaining the process and next steps, or prepare talking points for your call with them?"

      user: "I need to follow up with clients who might benefit from refinancing now that rates have dropped. Can you help me identify who to contact?",
      agent: "I'd be happy to help you identify refinance opportunities. Here's a strategic approach:\n\n1. Filter your client database for loans with rates at least 0.75-1% higher than current rates\n2. Prioritize clients who have had their loans for at least 6 months\n3. Focus on clients with good payment history and likely improved credit scores\n4. Consider clients with significant equity built up who might benefit from cash-out options\n\nFor your outreach campaign:\n- Create a personalized savings analysis for each client\n- Highlight both monthly payment savings and lifetime interest savings\n- Mention any streamlined refinance options they might qualify for\n\nWould you like me to draft a refinance opportunity email template that you can personalize for each client? I can also help you create a tracking system in the CRM to monitor these refinance opportunities."
