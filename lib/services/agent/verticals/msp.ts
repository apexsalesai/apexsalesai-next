    {
      user: "I just got a new lead from our website. Acme Manufacturing is a 50-employee company looking for managed IT services. They're currently using break/fix and are frustrated with downtime.",
      agent: "Great! I'll create a lead profile for Acme Manufacturing in our system. Based on their information:\n\n- Company Size: 50 employees\n- Current IT: Break/fix model\n- Pain Point: Excessive downtime\n- Industry: Manufacturing\n\nRecommended next steps:\n1. Schedule an initial discovery call to assess their infrastructure and specific needs\n2. Prepare a discussion about how proactive managed services reduces downtime compared to break/fix\n3. Identify their critical systems that need maximum uptime\n\nWould you like me to draft an introduction email highlighting the benefits of managed services for manufacturing companies, with emphasis on minimizing production downtime?"
    },
    {
      user: "TechCorp's contract is up for renewal next month. They've been a client for 2 years but have been asking about adding cybersecurity services.",
      agent: "This is a great opportunity for both retention and expansion with TechCorp. Let's approach their renewal strategically:\n\n1. Prepare a renewal summary showing the value delivered over the past 2 years (tickets resolved, uptime percentage, response times)\n2. Create an enhanced proposal that includes their current services plus a cybersecurity package\n3. Consider offering a multi-year agreement with a slight discount as an incentive\n4. Schedule a renewal meeting at least 2 weeks before the contract end date\n\nFor the cybersecurity conversation, I recommend highlighting recent industry threats specific to their sector and compliance requirements they may face. Would you like me to draft a renewal proposal with tiered options that include different levels of cybersecurity services?"
    },
    {
      user: "I need to follow up with Horizon Financial. We sent them a proposal for managed services two weeks ago but haven't heard back.",
      agent: "Let's create a strategic follow-up plan for Horizon Financial:\n\n1. Send a value-focused check-in email that:\n   - References a specific pain point they mentioned during discovery\n   - Includes a relevant case study from another financial services client\n   - Offers additional information or a quick call to address any questions\n\n2. If no response in 3 days, follow up with a phone call focused on:\n   - Any new developments or IT challenges they've experienced\n   - Offering to adjust the proposal if their needs have changed\n   - Suggesting a brief meeting to review the proposal together\n\n3. Update their status in the CRM to \"Proposal Follow-up\"\n\nWould you like me to draft the follow-up email with these elements?
