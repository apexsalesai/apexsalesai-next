## 🔗 Claude Access URLs

Once pushed to GitHub, Claude can fetch these files directly:

### Core Status (Read First)
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apexsalesai/apexsalesai-next/main/docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apexsalesai/apexsalesai-next/main/docs/DAILY_STANDUP.md
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apexsalesai/apexsalesai-next/main/docs/BLOCKERS.md
```

### Implementation Details
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apexsalesai/apexsalesai-next/main/docs/ITEM_B_STUDIO_UI.md
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apexsalesai/apexsalesai-next/main/docs/ITEM_C_CHANNEL_ADAPTERS.md
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apexsalesai/apexsalesai-next/main/docs/WINDSURF_SCOPE_LOCK_ITEM_B.md
```

### Metrics & Data
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apexsalesai/apexsalesai-next/main/reports/validation-report.json
```

---

## ⚠️ Important: Repository Access

**Current Status:** Repository is likely private

**Options:**

### Option 1: Make docs/ Public (Recommended)
- Keep main repo private
- Make `docs/` folder public via GitHub settings
- Claude can read without authentication

### Option 2: Provide Read Token
- Generate GitHub Personal Access Token (read-only)
- Give token to Claude
- Claude can fetch from private repo

### Option 3: Make Entire Repo Public
- Simplest option
- No authentication needed
- Consider if codebase should be open source

**Recommendation:** Option 1 (public docs, private code)
